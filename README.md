Implementing a method which takes multiple words, an array of words and returns a hash with a count of how many times a string or a substring appeared in the array.

For example:
  > dictionary = ["below","down","go","going","horn","how","howdy","it","i","low","own","part","partner","sit"]
  > substrings("below", dictionary)
  => { "below" => 1, "low" => 1 }
